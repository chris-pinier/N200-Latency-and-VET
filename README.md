<h1>Exploration of a Potential Relationship between N200 Peak-Latency and Visual Encoding Time</h1>
<h2>N200 Identification</h2>

<h1>Task Description</h1>
<h2>Dataset 1</h2>
Participants performed a version of a two-back continuous performance task that included rewards and
punishments, themselves communicated via auditory feedback tones. The participants were presented with a
succession of letters on a screen and had to determine with button presses whether any given letter was the same as
the one presented two occurrences earlier.

<h2>Dataset 2</h2>
Participants were presented with Gabor patches that were embedded in visual noise and varied in
orientations and spatial frequencies. The experiment consisted of two tasks, each containing three different block types
of increasing difficulty.
In the first one, the so-called “Signal task”, the goal was to classify Gabor patches into two categories of either low or
high spatial frequencies. The patches were presented with an orientation of either 45 or 135 degrees and the difficulty
was increased between the three block types by lowering the discrepancy in spatial frequency between the two
categories:

- Easy: low frequency patches were shown at 2.35 cycles per degree (cpd), and high frequency patches at 2.65 cpd
(0.3 cpd difference).
- Medium: low frequency patches were shown at 2.4 cpd and high frequency patches at 2.6 cpd (0.2 cpd
difference).
- Hard: low spatial frequency patches were shown at 2.45 cpd and high spatial frequency patches at 2.55 cpd (0.1
cpd difference).  

The goal of the second task (Signal-Response (SR) Mapping) depended on the difficulty of the block. Gabor patches were
once again presented with an orientation of either 45 or 135 degrees, but this time the spatial frequency was kept
constant for the two categories across block types, with low and high frequency patches shown at 2.4 cpd and 2.6 cpd,
respectively. The goal of the task varied as follows:
- Easy: participants were asked to respond by pressing a single button whenever they detected any Gabor patch.
- Medium: participants had to discriminate low and high frequency patches by pressing one of two buttons.
- Hard: participants had to discriminate the patches based on both spatial frequency and orientation by pressing
one of two buttons. As an example, one button corresponded to patches with both high spatial frequency and a
45-degree orientation, while the other corresponded to patches with both low spatial frequency and an
orientation of 135 degrees


<h2>Dataset 3</h2>
Participants performed a random dot motion task where the goal, in each trial, was to determine
whether an array of moving dots is shifting to the left or to the right of the screen. The array contains two types of dots,
together forming a borderless circle. In one type, each dot is independently moving in pseudo-random directions while,
in the other, the dots are collectively moving either toward the left or the right. The task included two different
conditions: accuracy trials, in which the participants were asked to respond as accurately as they could, and speed trials,
in which they were asked to respond as quickly as they could. The array of dots was shown for 1.5 second on each trial
and visual feedback was given after every response.
